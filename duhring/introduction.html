		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			In the preface for the first edition, Engels says that he wrote this book against
			Herr Duhring, who supposedly proposed a new “System” for science, as well as
			socialism. This new system might’ve led to a split in the german socialist party,
			So Engels felt the need to write a refutation. In the preface to the second edition,
			Engels mentions that after many years of this polemic’s release, a new edition
			came out where he didn’t alter any previously made arguments because Duhring
			wasn’t able to respond back to the new arguments. Engels just added a new
			section to Part II which is “From the critical history” which Marx wrote with
			the help of Engels. Engels didn’t bother correcting anything other than that
			because at that time his priority was publishing the other volumes of Capital. In
			the preface for the third edition, nothing major happens. Engels just shortens
			the section he previously added.

		<h3>General</h3>
		<p>
			Engels here highlights how the french revolution was based around bourgeois
			values. Bourgeois equality, bourgeois property, bourgeois justice, and that the
			Social Contract of Rousseau came into existence as a bourgeois democratic re-
			public. This happened because of the revolution of the bourgeoisie against the
			noble, where the bourgeoisie claimed to represent all of humanity under the val-
			ues of absolute justice, absolute equality, absolute fairness. Later on, as we see,
			the values presented by the bourgeois were bourgeois justice, bourgeois equality
			and bourgeois fairness. This is precisely what Utopic Socialism is, the justifica-
			tion of socialism on the basis of metaphysical absolutes. To the English, French
			and first German Socialists, socialism is the expression of absolute truth, reason
			and justice. Of course, we now know that all of this is merely subjective moral
			claims, conditioned by one’s material conditions and subjective understanding
			of what is moral or not. Those systems of metaphysical absolutes will always
			end up in Nihilism, as Nietzsche says, “The belief in categories of reason is
			the cause of Nihilism: we have measured the worth of the world according to
			categories which can only be applied to a purely fictitious world.” This was
			the prevalent mode of thinking from Bacon to Locke, the metaphysical mode of
			thinking. What Engels advocated for is a dialectical view of the world, nature in
			motion. What Engels and Marx did was show a scientific backing to Socialism,
			independent of bourgeois metaphysics. This came with the discovery of Surplus
			Value and the materialist conception of history: Historical materialism.
