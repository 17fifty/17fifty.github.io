		<h3> Section 1: The two factors of a commodity Use-value and Value (The substance of Value and the Magnitude of Value)</h3>
		<p>An economy with a capitalist mode of production produces commodities, “The
			wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears
			as an ’immense collection of commodities’”. “A commodity is an external object
			which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind. The nature
			of these needs whether they arise from the stomach, or the imagination makes
			no difference.” A use-value of a commodity is the qualitative aspect of a given
			product, its utility. For example, a hammer’s general utility is to hammer nails.
			Use values are only realized in consumption, a use-value is independent from the
			social nature of a commodity. As soon as a commodity enters a market it now
			has an Exchange-value. An exchange-value is the exchange of one kind of use-
			value for another. Exchange value is the quantitative aspect of a commodity.
			For example, how many hammers would I need to exchange for a screwdriver?
			That relation is a quantitative one. </p>
		<b> x Hammer = y Screwdriver </b>
		<p>this relation shows a common element in which we can equate a number of ham-
			mers to a number of screwdrivers, this is an exchange relation. As we said, this
			relation is independent of the qualitative aspects of both commodities that are
			being exchanged, it is independent of their use-values. Therefore the common
			element that we use to equate those two commodities is not a physical aspect
			of the commodities, but the abstraction of human labour. So what remains is
			the value of those commodities, and the value of a commodity is the amount
			of socially necessary labour required to produce this product. The magnitude
			of value is measured by the quantity of value forming substance, the labour,
			in the commodity. This quantity is measured by labour-time, the time neces-
			sary to preform the labour necessary to produce this commodity (days, weeks,
			months...etc). We use the term socially necessary labour-time[1] to denote the
			average labour-time under normal production conditions necessary to produce
			a commodity. Marx gives this example to explain the importance of socially
			necessary labour-time: “The introduction of power-looms into England, for ex-
			ample, probably reduced by one half the labour required to convert a given
			quantity of yarn into woven fabric. In order to do this, the English hand-loom
			weaver in fact needed the same amount of labour-time as before; but the prod-
			uct of his individual hour of labour now only represented half an hour of social
			labour, and consequently fell to one half its former value.”
